# User styles

This repository contains all of the websites and applications that I have themed or styled using CSS.

Pull requests are welcome.

## Websites

Website themes can be applied through [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/), they are being hosted on [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/) to be easily discovered by everyone.

- [ ] Element ([element.io](https://app.element.io)): Implementing Catppuccin Mocha WIP. [check it out!](./element.io/)

## Applications

Some applications can be themed, the method of styling may vary from app to app.

I don't see how you can license a bunch of CSS files, but all code in this repo (except the ones that are not written by me) are under the GPL v3 license.
